# Pepper Robot Coding
感謝大家一起參與 Pepper 的技能開發，相信大家在開發過 Pepper 的 Choregraphe Python 及 Android 程式後，應該就會有一種回不去的感覺，除了開發純UI畫面的軟體，也想同時開發硬體操控及互動的程式，感覺會有趣多了

將公佈 Pepper Coding Using Google API 及 Azure API 的上課教材完整範例程式
敬請期待~

有任何的問題，請於Issue提問喔，謝謝~


Thank you for participating in Pepper's skill development. I believe that after you have developed Pepper's Choregraphe Python and Android programs, you should have a feeling of getting back. In addition to developing pure UI graphics software, you also want to develop hardware control and Interactive program, it will be much more interesting

A complete sample program for the teaching materials of Pepper Coding Using Google API and Azure API will be announced.

If you have any questions, please ask questions in Issue, thank you~
